Former decent video game player who legitimately grinded. Difficult as it may sound, this experience provided me with invaluable firsthand insight into game mechanics and competitive integrity.

## Scope

- In-depth runtime analysis of protected game environments.  
- Development of internal and external hacks, including kernel-level components.  
- Stealth memory manipulation, with the injection technique as the key detection factor.  
- Kernel-user communication and syscall management.  
- Trace-resistant execution layers and ring0 interfaces.

## Tech Stack

- Proficient in C, C++, ASM (x86/x64), Python, Lua, Java, C#  
- Skilled in using HXD (MY GOAT), IDA Pro, x64dbg, WinDbg, Visual Studio, Sysinternals, and custom tooling.

## Anticheat Awareness

- Execution methods focused on reducing footprint and exposure.  
- Understanding that total invisibility is impossible against advanced kernel anticheats like Vanguard.  
- Use of signed kernel driver to improve stealth while ensuring system integrity.  
- Emphasis on risk reduction and maximizing evasion, informed by community insights and real-world detection patterns.

## Operational Status

- Ongoing, confidential research in protected environments.  
- No public releases, distributions, or archives.

## Development Approach

- Tools are tailored and single-use for each environment.  
- No code reuse or exposure to external parties.  
- Ensures clean termination and purely volatile states.
