Former decent video game player who legitimately grinded. Difficult as it may sound, this experience provided me with invaluable firsthand insight into game mechanics and competitive integrity.

## Scope

- In-depth runtime analysis of protected game environments.  
- Development of internal and external hacks, including kernel-level components.  
- Stealth memory manipulation, with the injection technique as the key detection factor.  
- Kernel-user communication and syscall management.  
- Trace-resistant execution layers and ring0 interfaces.

## Tech Stack

- Proficient in C, C++, ASM (x86/x64), Python, Lua, Java, C#  
- Skilled in using HXD (MY GOAT), IDA Pro, x64dbg, WinDbg, Visual Studio, Sysinternals, and custom tooling.

## Anticheat Awareness

- Execution methods focused on reducing footprint and exposure.  
- Understanding that total invisibility is impossible against advanced kernel anticheats like Vanguard.  
- Use of signed kernel driver to improve stealth while ensuring system integrity.  
- Emphasis on risk reduction and maximizing evasion, informed by community insights and real-world detection patterns.

## Operational Status

- Ongoing, confidential research in protected environments.  
- No public releases, distributions, or archives.

## Development Approach

- Tools are tailored and single-use for each environment.  
- No code reuse or exposure to external parties.  
- Ensures clean termination and purely volatile states.

## Past Projects

- Implemented a spoofer combined with in-depth BIOS research, allowing serial modifications directly at the firmware level, adaptable depending on the motherboard manufacturer.  
- Implemented an auto-offsets updater to keep cheats ready immediately after small patches with zero downtime.  
- Implemented TPM, HVCI, Secure Boot, and IOMMU bypasses preventing game closures due to disabled security features.  
- Implemented a TPM serial randomizer (hooks and overwrite) before it was patched.  
- Implemented a near-perfect external aimbot with configurable smooth, legit aiming and desync control, extensively tested on long sessions with trusted testers.  
- Implemented a fully synced, reliable triggerbot complementing the aimbot.  
- Implemented a decent ESP featuring box and skeleton visuals displaying player models, weapons, and health.  
- Implemented “La Toupis,” a widely recognized tool within cheat developer communities.  
- Implemented a skinchanger and custom launcher for League of Loosers.  
- Implemented various projects on Minecraft, CS2, and F0Rtn1tegg.  
- All remain private, focusing on deep research and skill development over commercial distribution, with over 3 years of continuous work.
